# Deep Learning Playground

This repository serves as my playground for exploring and implementing deep learning concepts from scratch. The focus is on building artificial neural networks (ANN) using Python and NumPy.

## Contents

1. **01_Premier_neurone.ipynb**
   - Introduction to neural networks.
   - Implementation of a simple neural network with mathematical details.
   - Gradient descent and forward propagation.

2. **02_ANN_2couches.ipynb**
   - Building a neural network with two hidden layers.
   - Backpropagation algorithm and parameter updates.
   - Visualization of the training process.

3. **03_ANN_n_couches.ipynb**
   - Generalizing to neural networks with arbitrary hidden layers.
   - Modular architecture for flexible network configuration.
   - Training on more complex datasets.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the notebooks and experiment with different configurations. These notebooks are designed for educational purposes, providing insights into the inner workings of neural networks.

## Getting Started
