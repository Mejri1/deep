# üß† Deep Learning Playground

This repository is a personal space to explore and implement core deep learning concepts **from scratch** using **Python** and **NumPy**. It focuses on understanding how artificial neural networks (ANNs) work under the hood, without using deep learning frameworks.

## üìö Notebooks

### `01_Premier_neurone.ipynb`
- Build a basic single-layer neural network
- Understand forward propagation and gradient descent
- Includes step-by-step math explanations

### `02_ANN_2couches.ipynb`
- Build a neural network with two hidden layers
- Implement backpropagation manually
- Visualize training progress

### `03_ANN_n_couches.ipynb`
- Generalize to networks with any number of layers
- Use a modular code structure
- Train on more complex datasets (e.g., moons, blobs)
